// address, then swap there on public liquidity (Jupiter). The on-chain trail
// never ties the swap back to the wallet that funded the deposit.
//
// Trust model — non-custodial. The fresh keypair is generated here, inside the
// user's wallet, and never leaves it: the withdraw funds the fresh address, the
// swap is signed locally with the fresh key, and the routing service only ever
// sees a public key. A privacy relayer that could sign could steal; this one
// cannot, and because the withdraw self-funds the fresh address the swap pays
// its own gas without the server holding anything.
//
// Availability: with `reshield` the swapped SPL token is re-shielded into a
// shielded note via deposit_note_spl (#779) — a true round trip (shielded SOL ->
// shielded token). Without it (or for a "SOL" output) the token is left at the
// fresh address as a private *buy*. Re-shielding is best-effort and fund-safe:
// the token is already persisted at the fresh address before it runs, so a
// failed re-shield simply leaves a private buy rather than stranding anything.
