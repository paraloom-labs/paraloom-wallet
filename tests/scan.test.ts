// Recipient discovery is the one place the wallet stores a note it did not
// create, from a payload a stranger can produce: the box public key that gates
// decryption is the public half of the shielded address, so anyone who knows an
// address can seal a ciphertext to it claiming any amount. #196 is the defence
// — recompute the commitment under OUR spend key and drop the note unless it
// matches the leaf it was delivered with.
//
// Every rejection path here is a silent `continue`, and that is correct: a
// stranger's note and a crafted note both have to look like "nothing for you".
// It also means a regression is silent — the balance is simply wrong, and
// #196's phantom notes were unspendable, so the wallet would brick on the next
// transfer with nothing pointing back at the scan.
//
// The prover is mocked because the wasm binary is a build input that is not in
// the repo. These tests therefore pin the control flow — that the commitment is
// recomputed, that it is recomputed under this wallet's own spend key, and that
// a mismatch drops the note — and not Poseidon itself. A test that the real
// hash is correct would need the prover artifacts.
