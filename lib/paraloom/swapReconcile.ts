// Reconcile stranded private-swap rows against on-chain reality so the Activity
// feed stops showing swaps as "Pending" forever. A swap row is saved early (with
// an empty swapSignature) so its fresh-address key can never be lost; the second
// write that fills in the realized amount + signature is what marks it done. If
// that second write is lost (the service worker slept, the page timed out), the
// row is stuck pending even though the money is safe. This resolves each such row
// to its true outcome:
//
//   - resume:     the fresh address still holds the withdrawn SOL and the swap
//                 leg never ran → finish the swap (idempotent: the input note was
//                 already consumed by the settled withdraw, so no double-spend).
//   - landed:     the swap already ran and the bought token sits at the fresh
//                 address, only the local record was lost → record it as done.
//   - unresolved: nothing recoverable at the fresh address. Either the swap
//                 completed and re-shielded (funds back in the pool) or the
//                 withdraw never settled (input note still safe). Left untouched
//                 for the user to dismiss manually — we never auto-close a row we
//                 cannot positively account for, so a transient RPC blip can never
//                 hide a genuinely recoverable strand.
