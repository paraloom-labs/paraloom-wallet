 * mint is dropped rather than stored mintless: `shieldedBalance` filters on
 * `!n.mint`, so a token note with no mint would be counted as SOL, and a wrong
 * number the user acts on is worse than an invisible one. Dropping it is also
 * exactly what a node that has not shipped #23 yet produces today.
 *
 * The wire carries hex; `ShieldedNote.mint` is base58, which is what the spend
 * path feeds to `new PublicKey` and what token metadata is keyed by. Storing
 * the wire form would give a note that can be discovered but not spent.
